# Multilayer_Perceptron

Question: 
Implement an articial neural network (ANN) by stacking up your perceptron. The architecture of the ANN is up to you. Use sigmoid function for activation function and backpropagation to train your ANN. Use the same MNIST data for training and testing. Print out accuracy,
precision and recall at the end.
